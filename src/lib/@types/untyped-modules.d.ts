/**
 * Ambient declarations for the three runtime dependencies that ship no types and have no
 * `@types` package on npm: `tar-fs`, `dropbox-v2-api` and `node-wol`.
 *
 * These deliberately describe only the surface BackItUp actually uses instead of trying to be a
 * complete typing of those libraries - a partial but accurate declaration is more useful than a
 * broad one that claims more than it can guarantee.
 *
 * Note on `tar-fs`: `@types/tar-fs` exists but only covers the 2.x line, while this adapter runs
 * tar-fs 3.x, whose streams come from `streamx` rather than from `node:stream`. Both still satisfy
 * the `.pipe()` / `.on('error')` / `.on('finish')` usage in lib/targz.ts, which is all that is
 * declared here.
