/**
 * `BackItUpAdapterOptions` in lib/types.d.ts is what gives `adapter.config` its type. Nothing forces
 * it to stay in step with the `native` defaults in io-package.json, and in the first TypeScript
 * attempt (PR #1190) it had drifted by 13 keys before anyone noticed. This test makes that drift a
 * test failure instead of a silent lie in the type system.
 *
 * A key may be intentionally absent from `native` while still being declared - deprecated settings
 * that main.js only reads to migrate older instance configurations. Those must be marked optional,
 * which is how this test tells "deliberately kept" apart from "forgotten".
